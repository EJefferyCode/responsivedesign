# responsivedesign

<h1>This is my attempt at creating a responsive web page</h1>

<p>I struggled with the heading at first, but then got the hang of it. I used my previous projects as a reference. I also
had issues with the nth-child, but that's something I need to work on a bit more. Feel free to message me regarding this, or,
any other project, as well as fork this project and add to it as you see it. Thanks, Emmy J</p>
